# CO2-capture-process-plainning



## Selection version 1
Use Bender decomposition to do process selection.  
Master problem: Minimizing the lower bond ($\theta$)  
Subproblem: Minimizing overall selected process cost, including capital cost, operating cost, carbon permit, land use.

## Selection version 2
Use Bender decomposition to do process selection, but in this version subproblem is used for feasibility test.  
Master problem: Minimizing overall selected process cost.  
Subproblem: Evaluating the feasibility via increasing 10% and reducing 5% of processes' COâ‚‚ capture throughput.

## Selection version 3
Do the optimization through a two-stage optimization with two different objective function.  
First stage: Minimizing overall selected process cost.  
Second stage: Basing on the selection in the first stage to decide which process and how many of it can handle the electricity uncertainty with lowest cost.

## Selection version 4
### Version 4 optimization flowchart
<img src='optimization_flowchart.png'>
Do the optimization through a two-stage optimization while combining two objective functions together.  
First stage (Here-and-Now): Select the process with lowest capital cost.  
Second stage (Wait-and-see): Decide which process and how many of it should be activated when encountering the renewable electricity uncertainty, which is forecasted by Monter-Carlo model.  
  
The final result can be figured out as below:
